    <h1>A quick summary of who I am</h1>
    <p> My name is Ben, Im 14 years old and moved here from the philippines as a young child. These days I often spend a lot of my time in school or playing volleyball. Some other things I enjoy are video games and just being around my friends. Id like to say that I am a simple person, doing the same thing everyday and looking forward to playing volleyball. It's always been one of my most defining characteristics. Some other things I enjoy are anime and some books as a way to relax and calm my mind.
    </p>
